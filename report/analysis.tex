\section{Analysis}

\textit{In this section we will come back to the Two Generals problem and further analyse and realize that reaching consensus without a leader/authority, who can issue commands, is impossible. Then we will present Raft as a solution to this problem and compare it to other solutions and discuss why we have chosen it.}
